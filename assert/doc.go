// Package assert provides some simple but powerful testing helpers. These helpers are tested,
// and those tests do not use the helpers themselves (they are the only tests in the console library
// that don't use these helpers).
//
// They are designed to greatly simplify testing code, reduce code verbosity, and produce consistent
// and useful output during tests.
